This project consists of multiple projects that I am working on this year.
I have finished a calculator, a score keeper for the game Skull King, and I am working on Doodler which is mirrored after the game Drawful from Jackbox games.

I previously had the Skull King score keeper using AWS DynamoDB so that games could be played, stored, and accessed later. With the current version I wanted to learn about Redux so in the current version the data is stored using Redux.

Right now I am working on the Doodler game. I wanted to learn about and use Websockets which is why I chose to write the Doodler game. I think I am about half way through the project.
